# Abstract
Predicting the price of housing has an enormous importance for near-term economic forecasting of any nation. In an uncertain economic climate, construction companies are confronted with a daunting question: to build or not to build. Little research is reported in the construction literature on the price of housing. In this paper, we have discussed the prediction of the price of housing using some machine and deep learning models such as: **SVM, KNN, MLP, ANNs, CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, LightGBM, and CatBoost**. The models incorporate time-dependent and seasonal variations of the variables. The output of the model is an approximate price of a house given the features of the house. The models showed promising results on predicting housing prices.

# Introduction
To find research on the price of housing, one needs to search mostly the business, economic, finance, and real estate journals. A number of researchers have attempted to describe variables affecting the real state price dynamics or movements. Accurate cost estimation in early stages of construction projects leads to cost savings, thus contributing to a more sustainable project. The estimated cost is commonly computed based on the cost of project determinants such as construction materials, labor, equipment, and method. The construction cost depends on many other factors such as the project locality, type, construction duration, scheduling, and extent of use of recycled materials.

# Results
The CNN model achieves the best R-squared, MAE, and RMSE, while the LGBM model achieves the best cross validation score score.


# Conclusion
A purpose of the paper was to introduce a comparison among different machine learning and deep learning models to help in the field of construction estimation. Concern about such data is the proportion of the number of data sets to the number features. The higher dimensionality, the larger the number of training samples required for accurate cost estimation. The models were presented for predicting the price of a building. This will minimize the cost and the effort to find a suitable house.
